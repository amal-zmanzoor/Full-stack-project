# Full-stack-project
This project includes both a frontend form, made using HTML and CSS, along with a backend PHP script for handling form submissions and database interactions.
The form is the user interface through which users input data.
The backend component, written in PHP, receives the form data, performs server-side validation, interacts with the database (MySQL), and provides appropriate responses to the frontend.

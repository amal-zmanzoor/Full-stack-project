# Full-stack-project
This project includes both a front-end form, made using HTML and CSS, along with a back-end PHP script for handling form submissions and database interactions.
The form is the user interface through which users input data.
The back-end component, written in PHP, receives the form data, performs server-side validation, interacts with the database (MySQL), and provides appropriate responses to the front-end.
